# Things i learned.

- Using multiplier can work so long as we store the remainder as well. This is because not all values divide evenly by the range of multipliers 1-16.

- Instead it might be easier to just use more bits to store the difference.
  - And thats what i did. I used 30 bits instead of 16.
